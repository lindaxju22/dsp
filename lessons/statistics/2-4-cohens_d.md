[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?
>>
>> A: First babies slightly are lighter than others (7.20 vs 7.33). Cohen's d is -0.089 compared to 0.029 as difference in pregnancy length.

>> ```python
>> import nsfg

>> live = preg[preg.outcome == 1]
>> 
>> firsts = live[live.birthord == 1]
>> others = live[live.birthord != 1]
