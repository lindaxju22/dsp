[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> *The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.*
>>
>> *Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?*
>>
>> A: The distribution is uniform. The PMF shows the same probability for all values and the CDF shows that all values have proportional percentile rank. The plots are shown by running the following code.
>>
>> ```python
>> t = np.random.random(1000)
>> 
>> pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
>> thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
>> thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')
>> 
>> cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
>> thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
>> thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')
>> ```
